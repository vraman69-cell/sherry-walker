                <h2>My Commitment to Guilford County - District 4</h2>
                <p>My professional passion is working with the community to better the lives of our children. I truly believe that it takes a village to raise a child, and I want to bring that collaborative spirit to the Guilford County Board of Education representing District 4.</p>
                
                <p>Through my part-time consulting business, I work with new parents to provide the necessary skills and guidance to raise well-rounded children. This hands-on experience has shown me what families need and what our schools must provide to help every child succeed.</p>
                
                <p>I believe that children should be well-rounded in reading, math, and social skills. When all three of these foundational skills are mastered, we have children who are truly prepared for life's lessons and ready to contribute to our community.</p>

                <div class="platform-item">
                    <h3>1. HVAC Systems Matter</h3>
                    <p>Every student and teacher deserves a safe, comfortable learning environment. Proper heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems are not luxuries—they are necessities for effective learning and teaching. I will advocate for maintaining and upgrading HVAC systems across District 4 schools to ensure optimal learning conditions year-round.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="platform-item">
                    <h3>2. Reduce Classroom Sizes</h3>
                    <p>Smaller class sizes mean more individual attention for each student. When teachers can focus on fewer students, they can better identify learning needs, provide personalized instruction, and build meaningful relationships. I will work to reduce class sizes so that every child receives the attention they deserve to reach their full potential.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="platform-item">
                    <h3>3. Mental Health Days for Teachers</h3>
                    <p>Teachers are the backbone of our education system, and they need support too. Teachers need mental health days to recharge, maintain their wellbeing, and continue providing excellent education to our students. I will advocate for policies that recognize and support teacher mental health as essential to student success.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="platform-item">
                    <h3>4. Teacher Retention</h3>
                    <p>I believe in teacher retention. Great teachers are the foundation of great schools, and we must create an environment where educators want to stay and build their careers. I will work to ensure competitive compensation, supportive working conditions, and the resources teachers need to thrive in District 4 schools.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="platform-item">
                    <h3>5. Teaching Kindness</h3>
                    <p>Teaching kindness is fundamental to building strong school communities. When we teach children to be kind, respectful, and compassionate, we create a positive learning environment where everyone can succeed. I will support programs and initiatives that make kindness a core value in our schools.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="platform-item">
                    <h3>6. Policies That Make Sense</h3>
                    <p>Making policy that makes sense to teachers and parents is essential. Educational policies should be practical, clearly communicated, and developed with input from the people they affect most—our teachers and parents. I will ensure that District 4 policies are reasonable, understandable, and serve the best interests of our students.</p>

                <div class="platform-item">
                    <h3>7. Foster Strong Community Partnerships</h3>
                    <p>It takes a village to educate a child. I will work to strengthen partnerships between schools, families, and community organizations to create a support network around every student in District 4.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="platform-item">
                    <h3>8. Support Parents and Families</h3>
                    <p>Parents are a child's first teachers. I will advocate for programs and resources that equip parents with the tools they need to support their children's education at home, drawing on my experience working with families through my consulting business.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="platform-item">
                    <h3>9. Prepare Students for Life Success</h3>
                    <p>Education should prepare students not just for tests, but for life. I believe children should be well-rounded in reading, math, and social skills. When all three of these foundational skills are mastered, we have children who are truly prepared for life's lessons.</p>

                <h2>Why I'm Running</h2>
                <p>I'm running for the Guilford County Board of Education - District 4 because I believe every child deserves an education that prepares them for success in life. Our children are our future, and the decisions we make today will shape the opportunities available to them tomorrow.</p>
                
                <p>With my experience working directly with families and children, I understand both the challenges parents face and the needs of our students. I want to bring that perspective to the school board to ensure we're making decisions that truly serve our children and our community.</p>
                
                <p>Together, we can build a school system where every child receives a well-rounded education, where parents feel supported and heard, and where our community comes together to invest in the next generation.</p>
